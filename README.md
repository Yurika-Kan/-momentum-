**The Spark ⟢
**
We’ve all been there—starting a personal project with excitement, only to lose motivation along the way. Our team realized that what we needed wasn’t just discipline, but a support system. That’s why we built Momentum—a platform that matches developers with teammates and mentors, giving them the push they need to bring their software projects to life!

What Momentum Does ༄
Momentum connects coders who are driven to make waves by providing the tools and support they need to succeed: ~ Project Creation & Team Building – Users can create projects and receive team member requests, or explore existing projects and apply to join. ~ AI-Powered Mentor Matching – Our algorithm analyzes a project’s tech stack and needs, then automatically assigns the most qualified mentor from our database to guide the team. ~ Scrum Resources for Success – In addition to teammates and mentors, users have access to a resources page that walks them through the Scrum framework, helping them stay organized and on track throughout their projects. Momentum is more than just a platform—it’s a community where coders can collaborate, grow, and achieve their goals together.

How We Built It ⚙
Frontend: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS Backend: TypeScript, Next.js API routes, Prisma, PostgreSQL AI Integration: ChatGPT API for mentor matching Version Control: GitHub for collaboration


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
